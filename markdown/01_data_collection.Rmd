In this text, we document how to obtain the annotated data used as training set. These data sets are described in the following two papers:

+ [Portable automatic text classification for adverse drug reaction detection via multi-corpus training](http://diego.asu.edu/Publications/ADRClassify.html)
+ [Mining Twitter for Adverse Drug Reaction Mentions: A Corpus and Classification Benchmark]( http://www.nactem.ac.uk/biotxtm2014/papers/Ginnetal.pdf
)

The datasets are very easy to collect: on the first website linked above all data are available together with a [Python script](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/download_binary_twitter_data.py) that does the data collection process: it suffices to download the [data](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/adr_classify_twitter_data.txt) into any folder and then run the Python script as documented in the [readme](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/twitter_binary_data_readme.txt).  

Additionally there is a dataset [ADR Lexicon](http://diego.asu.edu/downloads/publications/ADRMine/ADR_lexicon.tsv) allowing us to deduce specific conditions from text.
